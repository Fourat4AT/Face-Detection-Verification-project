# Face Detection & Verification Project

This project demonstrates face detection and verification using Python. It leverages pre-trained deep learning models to detect faces in images and verify whether two faces match. Perfect for applications like attendance systems, identity verification, or general computer vision learning.

## Features

- **Face Detection:** Uses **MTCNN** to detect faces in images with bounding boxes and key points.
- **Face Verification:** Uses **FaceNet** to extract embeddings and verify if two faces belong to the same person.
- **Python Implementation:** Entire project coded in Python with real-world images.
- **Easy to Run:** Works in local Python environment or Google Colab.
